# Trading_with_reinforcement_learning
 
This repo demonstrates the use of a DQN to train and test a trading bot built and trained with reinforcement learning.
Please run main.py as a demonstration of the bot works. The current bot is trained on daily OHLCV data from SPY.

### TODO
 - add dueling Q networks
 - add limit order book data
 - add other technical indicators such as bollinger bands and RSI
